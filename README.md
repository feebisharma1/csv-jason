# _SBCotton_



> Over the second week of April, _SBCotton_ organized a Hackathon where eight of us participated and divided into two groups for the project. One group was working on front end of the project and another group was working on the back end of the project. The project that we were given was to create a _Data Lake Explorer Web App_ and mangement tool set.



### My Job

> I chose to be in a back end group and use all the exciting tools and methods I have never used it before. In order to start off the project, I downloaded _NodeJS_ and installed it. Then, I search for some database on the internet which was on _CSV_ file. I uploaded it on the template starter project of _VSCode_ that was given by _SBCotton_ where I created my own separate folder naming CSV. Then I created a file under CSV where I wrote a _Type Script_ code to parse CSV to .JSON file. After getting a beautiful output, my next step was to upload .JSON file in S3 on _Amazon Web Services_. In order to do that, I installed _AWS_ on _VSCode_ via terminal. I was provided the sign in information for _AWS_ from _SBCotton_. Then I created a bucket inside _AWS_ and wrote a code on _VSCode_ to upload it in S3. Not only that, I uploaded all my files in _AWS Lambda_ which is the cloud service of _AWS_. Doing this, my code will run in the cloud instead of in my computer. This is how I created a back end of the *Data Lake Explorer Web App*.
